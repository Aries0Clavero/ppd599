# Assignment 4: Spatial analysis

See syllabus for due date.

You will conduct a spatial analysis using a spatial dataset (ideally the same one from throughout the semester to support your final project). Create a new Jupyter notebook. The first cell of your notebook should be markdown explaining where you found your data set and what it contains.

Use geopandas to load your data set and clean/process it as needed. Using the techniques we learned in class, do the following:

  1. conduct a spatial analysis to look for hot/cold spots and assess spatial autocorrelation
  1. compute spatial diagnostics to pick an appropriate spatial regression model
  1. estimate and interpret a spatial regression model

Each step above should be followed by a markdown cell that succinctly explains your analysis/visuals, why you set it up the way you did, and how you interpret its results. What does the model tell you? How can planners or policymakers use this finding?

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals can be seen inline (without me having to re-run your notebook). Then submit your notebook and your data file(s), zipped, via Blackboard.
