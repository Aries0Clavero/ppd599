# Final Project

The final project is a cumulative assignment that requires you to use the skills you developed over the entire semester. It has two deliverables: a conference paper and a presentation. You will conduct a research study, write it up as a conference paper, and present it to the class.

## Instructions

### Paper

Identify a conference of interest and familiarize yourself with their paper submission requirements.

Develop an urban research question that fits with the themes of your chosen conference. Develop a research design to answer this question, then collect data, clean and organize it, visualize it, and analyze it.

Write a conference paper organized into five sections:

  1. introduction: provide a short (~3 paragraph) overview of the study's importance, methods, findings, and implications
  2. background: explain the context of your study and a short lit review of relevant related work
  3. methods: present your data and your analysis methods with sufficient detail that I could reproduce your study
  4. results: present your findings and relevant visuals
  5. discussion: circle back to your research question, interpret your findings, and discuss their importance and how planners or policymakers could use them to improve urban living

Format your paper according to the conference's guidelines. For the purposes of this course, your paper must be at least 3000 words in length (not including tables, figures, captions, or references). It must include the following:

  - a table of descriptive statistics
  - a table of spatial regression or machine learning model results
  - at least 4 figures containing data visualizations, including at least 1 map

You are encouraged, but not required, to actually submit this paper to the conference.

### Presentation

Prepare and deliver a 10 minute presentation, with slides, to present your conference paper during the last week of class.

## Submission

See syllabus for due dates. Via Blackboard, submit a zip file containing the paper (as PDF), all images, and the Jupyter notebook(s) and data files used to conduct this study. Make sure everything is runnable and reproducible. Late final project submissions will not be accepted or graded, so try to submit a little early just to be safe.
