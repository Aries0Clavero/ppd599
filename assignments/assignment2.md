# Assignment 2: Descriptive analysis

See syllabus for due date.

You will clean, organize, describe, and visualize the data you downloaded in assignment 1. Create a new Jupyter notebook. The first cell of your notebook should be markdown explaining where you found your data set and what it contains.

Load your data set and clean/process it as needed. Given your proposed project, identify at least two variables of interest and calculate relevant descriptive statistics. Using the techniques we learned in class, visualize interesting aspects of your data set. Next, create at least 4 visualizations using at least 3 different visualization types.

Each visualization should be followed by a markdown cell that explains what you are visualizing and why it is interesting. What story does it tell? How do the visuals enrich, confirm, or contradict the descriptive statistics you calculated earlier? Interpret the descriptive statistics and visualizations in the context of your research question and what evidence they provide for your hypotheses.

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors and that all the visuals can be seen inline (without me having to re-run your notebook). Then submit your notebook and your data file(s), zipped, via Blackboard.
